This includes Esri [basemaps](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/switching-basemaps.html) and [feature services](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-feature-layer.html), as well as [tiled](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/tile-layer-2.html) map, [dynamic](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-dynamic-map-layer.html) map and [image](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/simple-image-map-layer.html)  services.\n\n> Esri Leaflet is maintained with :heart: by folks spanning multiple teams within Esri, but we provide no guarantee of individual features, nor a traditional product lifecycle to support planning.\n\nThe goal of this project is **not** to replace the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/) but rather to provide small components for *only some* aspects of the ArcGIS platform for developers who prefer to build mapping applications with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).\n\nWe are proud to facilitate a project which requires participation from our diverse user community in order to thrive and we welcome contributions from those [just getting their feet wet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/647) in open-source.\n\nSupport for [Geocoding](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder) services and [Geoprocessing](https://github.com/jgravois/esri-leaflet-gp) services, as well as service defined [rendering](https://github.com/esri/esri-leaflet-renderers) are available as well (via additional plugins).\n\n> If you'd like to display Esri services in *any* Leaflet application, we ask that you adhere to our [Terms of Use](#terms) and attribution requirements.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n  - [Demos](#demos)\n  - [Example](#example)\n  - [API Reference](#api-reference)\n  - [Additional Plugins](#additional-plugins)\n  - [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\n  - [Issues](#issues)\n  - [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Going Deeper](#going-deeper)\n  - [Development Instructions](#development-instructions)\n  - [Versioning](#versioning)\n  - [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Terms](#terms)\n- [Credit](#credit)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Demos\nWe've shared lots of sample code showing off many of the features of Esri Leaflet.\n\nhttp://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/\n\n## Example\nThe easiest way to get started is to load Esri Leaflet via [CDN](https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet). Here is an example you can copy/paste into your own `.html` file.\n\n![App](https://raw.github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/master/example.png)\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- Load Leaflet from CDN-->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.3/dist/leaflet.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.0.3/dist/leaflet-src.js\"></script>\n\n    <!-- Load Esri Leaflet locally, after cloning this repository -->\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet@2.0.8\"></script>\n\n    <style>\n      html, body, #map {\n        margin:0; padding:0;  width : 100%; height : 100%;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"map\"></div>\n    <script>\n      var map = L.map('map').setView([45.528, -122.680], 13);\n      L.esri.basemapLayer(\"Gray\").addTo(map);\n\n      var parks = L.esri.featureLayer({\n        url: \"https://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Portland_Parks/FeatureServer/0\",\n        style: function () {\n          return { color: \"#70ca49\", weight: 2 };\n        }\n      }).addTo(map);\n\n      var popupTemplate = \"<h3>{NAME}</h3>{ACRES} Acres<br><small>Property ID: {PROPERTYID}<small>\";\n\n      parks.bindPopup(function(e){\n        return L.Util.template(popupTemplate, e.feature.properties)\n      });\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\nA full API Reference can be found in the Esri Leaflet website.\n\nhttp://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/api-reference/\n\nThe source code for the documentation site can be found in the repository below.  If you notice a typo or other problem, please [let us know](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-doc/issues)!\n\nhttps://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-doc\n\n## Additional Plugins\n\nMany folks have written plugins to customize and extend Leaflet.\n\nhttp://leafletjs.com/plugins.html\n\nYou can also pick and choose additional Esri Leaflet plugins.\n\nhttp://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/plugins/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* [What are the terms of use for ArcGIS Online services?](#terms)\n* [What exactly is Esri Leaflet?

[Fork and clone Esri Leaflet](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)\n2. `cd` into the `esri-leaflet` folder\n3. Install the [`package.json`](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/blob/master/package.json#L14-L49) dependencies by running `npm install`\n4. Run `npm start` from the command line. This will compile minified source in a brand new `dist` directory, launch a tiny webserver and begin watching the raw source for changes.\n5. Run `npm test` to make sure you haven't introduced a new 'feature' accidentally.\n6. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Esri Leaflet [1.x](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/releases/tag/v1.0.3) (available on [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/leaflet.esri/1.0.4/esri-leaflet.js)) can be used in apps alongside:\n  *  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) version 0.7.x.\n\n* Esri Leaflet [2.x](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/releases/tag/v2.0.7) (available on [CDN](https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet@2.0.7)) can be used in apps alongside:\n  *  [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) version 1.x.\n\nThe `master` branch of this repository is *only* compatible with Leaflet 1.x.\n\n### Versioning\n\nFor transparency into the release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Esri Leaflet is maintained under Semantic Versioning guidelines and will adhere to these rules whenever possible.\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit <http://semver.org/>.\n\n### Contributing\n\nEsri welcomes contributions from anyone and everyone. Please see our [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Terms\n\nIf you display an ArcGIS Online service in **any** Leaflet application, we require that you:\n\n1. Sign up for a [free developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/).\n2. Display Esri attribution and recognize data providers.\n\nUsing this plugin, it couldn't be easier to follow the terms.  Just select your basemap and the appropriate credits will always be displayed in Leaflet's own [Attribution control](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-attribution) as users pan/zoom automatically.\n\n```js\nL.esri.basemapLayer('Topographic').addTo(map);\n```\n\n![attribution](https://raw.github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/master/attribution.png)\n\nIf you need more than 1 million [map transactions](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/transaction-limits.htm) per month, please let us know.\n\n* [Esri Attribution Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/attribution/)\n* [ArcGIS Online Terms of Use](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/)\n\n### Credit\n\n* `L.esri.DynamicMapLayer` originally used code from [AGS.Layer.Dynamic.js](https://github.com/sanborn/leaflet-ags/blob/master/src/AGS.Layer.Dynamic.js)\n* `L.esri.TiledMapLayer` adapts some code from [arcgis-level-fixer](https://github.com/gisinc/arcgis-level-fixer)\n\n### Licensing\n\nCopyright 2016 Esri\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n> http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\nA copy of the license is available in the repository's [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.\n\n[](Esri Tags: ArcGIS Web Mapping Leaflet)\n[](Esri Language: JavaScript)\n",
